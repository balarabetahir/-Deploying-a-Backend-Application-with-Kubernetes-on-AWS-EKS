Deploying a backend application is one of those things that sounds harder than it actually is. At first, Kubernetes feels like this massive, incomprehensible system. AWS doesn’t help much either. There are dozens of services, each with their own quirks. But once you break it down, it starts to make sense. Like most complex things, it’s just a series of simpler steps stacked on top of each other.

Setting up the EKS cluster is the foundation. Using eksctl simplifies this process by handling the messy parts. Installing eksctl, configuring the AWS CLI, and running a simple command creates a functional Kubernetes cluster. AWS manages the control plane, networking, and node management, leaving you to focus on deployment.

Once the cluster is ready, pulling the backend code from a repository is straightforward. The key detail here is the Dockerfile — it must be correct because Kubernetes operates with containers, not raw code.

Containerizing the application with Docker is crucial. Building the Docker image and storing it in Amazon ECR makes it accessible to Kubernetes. Creating the repository, authenticating Docker with ECR, tagging, and pushing the image are essential steps to ensure Kubernetes can deploy the app.

Kubernetes manifests, written in YAML, define how the application should run and how it should be exposed. Defining deployments and services ensures Kubernetes knows how to manage replicas and provide external access via a load balancer.

Applying the manifests using kubectl initiates the deployment. Verifying the pods and services through both the command line and the AWS console confirms the deployment's success. AWS provisions a load balancer automatically, making the application accessible externally.

Attention to detail is vital throughout this process. Small mistakes, like missing Docker tags or YAML typos, can disrupt deployment. Verification at each stage minimizes these risks.

After deployment, the next logical steps are integrating CI/CD pipelines and configuring autoscaling. However, starting with a basic deployment allows for gradual improvement and a better understanding of Kubernetes and AWS.

Deploying with Kubernetes on AWS EKS can seem daunting, but by breaking it into clear steps, it becomes manageable. Starting small and iterating builds confidence and paves the way for more complex enhancements.
